publications:
  - title: Comparative Study of Large Language Model Methods for Ticket Classification
    conference: This Master thesis compares cutting-edge large language models on the task of ticket classifiction. The best performing model is fine-tuned using data from a specific use-case and deployed in a production environment.
  - title: Enhancing the Security of Terraform Scripts through Prompt Optimization of Large Language Models
    authors: Elias Berger, Valentin Hartig, Felix Sandmair, Maximilian Frank
    conference: The article discusses using large language models to generate secure Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations. The study evaluates the reliability of LLMs in generating secure IaC code, identifies common security vulnerabilities, and proposes a method for detecting and fixing them using an automatic prompt optimization scheme.


  - title: Handling uncertainty via conformal classification - a literature survey
    link: "https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiVt6aWVDGffE3MJ5e2oRU/ML_Seminar_Paper.pdf"
    conference: The paper suggests that improving the accuracy of machine learning models is not always sufficient for high-stakes applications, and that having a notion of confidence is crucial. The authors propose methods for handling uncertainty and providing statistical guarantees using the conformal prediction framework. The paper provides an overview of algorithms for addressing uncertainty in this context.

  - title: Development of a software prototype for modeling and simulating dynamic business models
    link: "https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fi32AVh7Prwjz7F1JzQqFJ/Bachelor_s_thesis.pdf"
    conference: The thesis develops a software prototype for modeling and simulating dynamic business models using the Business Model Canvas and System Dynamics. The objective is to gather quantitative data for optimizing business strategy or simulating future scenarios, with guidelines for the transfer process and limitations to consider.
