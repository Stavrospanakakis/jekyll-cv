# Profile
profile: |
  I am a young programmer where I aim to be able to post and get my footing in this science. 
  I am fascinated by the idea that I can understand how one of the most important tools we have as a human being works.
  But beyond the science part I have other hobbies,
  I like to read and work out and spend time with people I know and strangers.
